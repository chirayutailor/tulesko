#   Difference between Heap memory and Stack memory
#   On which memory will garbage collector will work
#   Can we have multiple classes with static void main method ?
#   What is the difference between Error and Exception ?

#   Can I create overloaded method with same method name and same parameters ( with same data type ) but different return type ?
    ==> Answer : No
    ==> Overloading methods depends only method-name, number-of-arguments and its data-type. It doesn't consider the return type at all.

#   Features of Java 8, Java 11 and Java 17

#   Difference between static variable and member variable
    --> Memory for static variable is created within heap area similar to member variable
    --> Memory for static variable is created during class loader while memory for member variable is created during object creation
    --> static variable memory cannot be cleared by garbage collector. Memory is cleared only when JVM exits the execution

# Types of interfaces
    ==> 3 types of interfaces: Normal interface, SAM ( Single Abstract Method ) interface ( ) and Marker Interface ( it has zero methods )
    ==> SAM interface example ( Runnable )
    ==> Marker interface example ( Serialize )
    ==> SAM interface is renamed to Functional interface in Java 8
    ==> Any interface having more than 1 method is called normal interface
