class --> blue print

Object --> Instance

Creation of Object --> Instantiation

new --> used to create object

Object --> Memory allocated inside Heap area

Instance variable --
  -> Created directly within a class
  -> Memory allocated inside heap(Within object)
  -> Default values are assigned
  -> Can be accessed anywhere within class also outside class using obj ref if not private
  ->

Local Variables --
 -> Created inside class within a method or loop or a block or constructor
 -> Memory is allocated inside stack area
 -> Default values are not assigned
 -> Can be accessed only within a method or block where ever they are defined. Scope is local

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->If we create object/instance memory is allocated in Heap area.
-->If there is no reference referring to object inside heap area then Garbage collector would collect the object
(In other words object memory is de allocated)

--> When ever we call a method or a block to execute then one stack will be created within stack area
    ---> when ever that method body or block body execution is over that stack will be deallocated from stack area

We can write methods in Java in four different ways based on needs refer class board notes for same;
