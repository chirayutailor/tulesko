Mutable String Object is such an Object which can be changed once is created.

There are 2 usual ways to create Immutable String Object :

String s="Telusko";  ---> String Constant pool of heap area( Only Once) --> Duplicates are not allowed

String s=new String("Telusko"); --> Heap area and refrence is referring to heap area String Object --> One copy also will be mainated on SCP my JVM with implicit references ( Hence new keyword --> 2 string objects) 00 refer class recordings and board work for more.

Note: refer live class recordings and board work for better clarity. 

Ways to compare String :

== -> References of Strings are compared
equals() --> actual String Object is compared
 equalsIgnoreCase() --> actual String Object will be compared ignoring case sensitivity

compareTo() --> String objects are compared lexicographically ( char by char) by considering dec rep of each char. 

Note : We have discussed more than this key points in live class. Kindly refer live class recordings and board work.
